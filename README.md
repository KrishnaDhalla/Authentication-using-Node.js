# Authentication-using-Node.js
The purpose of the website is to showcase the implementation of secure user authentication in a web application. The website allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected pages with secure authentication.
The website utilizes Node.js and its modules, such as Express, to handle HTTP requests and provide routing for the various pages of the website. It also makes use of a database, such as MongoDB, to store user information and credentials. The website uses bcrypt to securely hash and store passwords in the database, ensuring that user information is protected.
The website's user authentication process involves verifying a user's identity through the use of a username and password. When a user logs in, their credentials are verified against the information stored in the database, and if they match, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and stored as a cookie on the user's browser. The JWT contains information about the user's identity and serves as an authentication token for future requests.
In addition to using JWT for authentication, the website also uses cookies to keep track of a user's session and ensure that they remain logged in until they log out. When a user makes a request to a protected page, the website uses the JWT stored in the cookie to verify the user's identity and determine if they are authorized to access the page.
Overall, this website serves as an example of how to implement secure user authentication in a web application using Node.js and the combination of JWT and cookies. By demonstrating this process, the website provides a valuable resource for developers who are looking to implement similar functionality in their own projects.
